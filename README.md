# Lunar Crater Blender Models  

This repository contains Blender models of lunar craters used in the **2025 IEEE Aerospace Conference Paper: _Neural Radiance Methods for Terrain Modeling_**. These models were designed for simulating orbital camera systems and generating synthetic datasets to evaluate neural radiance field methods for terrain reconstruction.  

## Overview  

Lunar craters represent challenging terrain for 3D modeling due to their unique geometric and photometric properties. The Blender models in this repository were specifically crafted to support research on physically accurate 3D surface modeling and were utilized for the following purposes:  

- Simulating orbital cameras to collect multi-view imagery.  
- Testing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for terrain modeling.  
- Validating terrain reconstruction performance under varying illumination and view conditions.  

### Key Features  

- **High-Resolution Models**: Realistic lunar craters with accurate geometric details.  
- **Pre-configured Orbital Camera Systems**: Set up for easy simulation of orbital imaging scenarios.  
- **Customizable Lighting Conditions**: Includes configurations for sun angle and shadow simulation.
